## About the Weisman Digital Collection 

This demo collection features items from Pepperdine University's [Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art](https://arts.pepperdine.edu/museum/), and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm).

CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm is a template for creating digital collection exhibits on top of existing CONTENTdm repositories. 
The demo collection features images, document pdfs, audio, and YouTube video items to demonstrate the range of possibilities using the CollectionBuilder visualizations.

The Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art at Pepperdine University was founded in 1992. It showcases historical and contemporary art by nationally recognized artists, but focuses on the art of California.
Visit [Pepperdine's Digital Collection page](https://pepperdine.contentdm.oclc.org/) to view digital collections from the university archives and special collections.
